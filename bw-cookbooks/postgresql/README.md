Description
===========
This cookbook includes recipes and provider to install and configure postgresql database. This cookbook was tested with Postgresql 9.1 and 9.2, and should work with 9.0 too.

Changelog
=========
See CHANGELOG.md

Requirements
============
- This cookbook version (0.2.x) tested only on Debian squeeze and Ubuntu 12.04.
- You must have apt repository with Postgres version 9.x

Attributes
==========
This cookbook have server and client attribute files.

With client attributes(["postgresql"]["client"]) you can set only postgresql client and library version.

Server attributes are starting from ["postgresql"]["defaults"] and used as default attributes for postgresql provider. You should not override this defaults, you can pass your settings to provider instead.

Resources/Providers
===================
# Actions
- :create: creates postgresql cluster

# Attribute Parameters

- cluster_name: name attribute. Cluster name (e.g. main).
- cookbook: cookbook for templates. Skip this for default templates.
- databag: data bag for users and databases, if you don't want create users or databases with chef you can skip this.
- cluster_create_options: options for pg_createcluster (only locale related options)
- configuration: Hash with configuration options for postgresql. Configuration divided to sections, see examples.
- hba_configuration: Array with hba configuration, see examples.
- ident_configuration: Array with ident configuration, see examples.
- replication: Hash with replication configuration. Now provider supports only streaming replication. See examples. Cluster must be copied manually before chef run.

Examples
========
Example master database setup:

```ruby
postgresql "main" do
  cluster_create_options( "locale" => "ru_RU.UTF-8" )
  configuration(
    :version => "9.1",
    :connection => {
      :listen_addresses        => "'192.168.0.1'",
      :max_connections         => 300,
      :ssl_renegotiation_limit => 0
    },
    :resources => {
      :shared_buffers       => "512MB",
      :maintenance_work_mem => "64MB",
      :work_mem             => "8MB"
    },
    :queries => { :effective_cache_size => "512MB" },
    :wal     => { :checkpoint_completion_target => "0.9" },
    :logging => { :log_min_duration_statement => "200" }
  )
  hba_configuration(
    [
      { :type => "host", :database => "all", :user => "all", :address => "192.168.0.0/24", :method => "md5" },
      { :type => "host", :database => "replication", :user => "postgres", :address => "192.168.0.10/32", :method => "trust" }
    ]
  )
end
```

Example slave database setup:

```ruby
postgresql "main" do
  cluster_create_options( "locale" => "ru_RU.UTF-8" )
  configuration(
    :version => "9.1",
    :connection => {
      :listen_addresses        => "'192.168.0.10'",
      :max_connections         => 300,
      :ssl_renegotiation_limit => 0
    },
    :resources => {
      :shared_buffers       => "512MB",
      :maintenance_work_mem => "64MB",
      :work_mem             => "8MB"
    },
    :queries => { :effective_cache_size => "512MB" },
    :wal     => { :checkpoint_completion_target => "0.9" },
    :logging => { :log_min_duration_statement => "200" },
    :standby => { :hot_standby => "on" }
  )
  hba_configuration(
    [
      { :type => "host", :database => "all", :user => "all", :address => "192.168.0.0/24", :method => "md5" },
      { :type => "host", :database => "replication", :user => "postgres", :address => "192.168.0.10/32", :method => "trust" }
    ]
  )
  replication(
    :standby_mode =>"on",
    :primary_conninfo => "host=192.168.0.1",
    :trigger_file => "/tmp/pgtrigger"
  )
end
```
